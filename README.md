# Rental-Arbitrage-Engine
This project is a fully containerized, self-healing ELT data platform designed to identify rental arbitrage opportunities. It ingests short-term rental data (Airbnb) and compares it against long-term market lease rates (Zillow/Realty APIs) to calculate projected ROI for property investors.
